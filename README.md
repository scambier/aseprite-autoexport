aseprite-autoexport
===================

A simple Python script that automatically converts .ase files to .png

Put this script in the folder you want to watch, and let it run. It will scan the whole folder every 2 seconds to tranform `yourfile.ase` to `yourfile.png`.

It does not scan folders recursively, nor does it manage animations (yet).
